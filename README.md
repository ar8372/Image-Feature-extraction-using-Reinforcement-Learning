# Image Feature Extraction
<h3>Image-Feature-extraction-using-Reinforcement-Learning.</h3>

**Our algorithm converts an `image dataset` into `tabular dataset` by extracting features of image using reinforcement learning.**

## Procedure: 
 * Calculate transition matrix of an Image
 * Preprocess it to reduce computation
 * Assign pixels to grids
 * Assign reward to each state
 * Find center of figure
 * Calculate return and using it extract features
 * At the end we get 4 features corresponding to each image
